# Wealth.com Take-Home Coding Assignment

This project &mdash; created by Vaibhav Tank &mdash; is part of Wealth.com's take-home coding assignment, aimed at building an interactive family tree component in React. The goal is to create a dynamic family tree structure that can represent a client's immediate family—spouse and children—visually.
